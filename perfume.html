                        <p>Hello All,<br><br>
                            I fear the time has come to stop using my S.O.'s
                            perfumes. She has been quite accepting but says it's
                            time for me to have my own things, and I agree!
                            <br><br>I am looking for a light floral scent. My
                            S.O. is loyal to Daisy by Marc Jacobs, but when I
                            spray it it smells like lemon scented trash bags to
                            me at first.
                            <br><br>I don't mind splurging, but in that case I'd
                            prefer something I can wear year round.
                            <br><br>We are going to Sephora this Saturday-- and
                            on that note, will also be looking for a good primer
                            for (gasp!) middle-aged skin.
                            <br><br>Eager for your recommendations!

                        <p>unfortunately sephora is not a great
                            place for high quality fragrances.
                            <br><br>
                            i think a lot of tgirls/cd girls make the mistake
                            that
                            florals are inherently more femme because of floral
                            imagery, but this isn’t always the case. lots of
                            scents will be perceived as feminine.
                            <br><br>
                            the fragrance i recommend the most for tgirls who
                            are new to perfume is (in movie perfume) by
                            (designer).
                            it’s got a (notes notes notes notes notes etc). i
                            think it's particularly
                            good for tgirls because it’s not super offensive
                            and quite wearable for beginners
                            <br><br>
                            but if you’re committed to a light floral i’d
                            suggest experimenting at bath and body works, then
                            finding what they’re duping and order samples. make
                            sure to try
                            before you buy as splurging on something with a
                            girly bottle is not nearly as rewarding if you don't
                            like the scent.<br>
                            also some girls need to internalize that we all have
                            different chemistry and not every scent will work on
                            all skin. fragrence is not one size fits all.

                            Eliteism aside, I <i>do</i> think Donna Born in Rome by
                            Valentino is a great perfume.
                            <br><br>
                            I just splash it on whenever I'm going out or
                            dressing up for something! Plus my Donna is easier
                            to find cheap than (movie perfume), not counting 5
                            dollars for a less than an oz sample.
